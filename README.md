## A fully functional EXAMPLE project written in Go showing how to create a collatz conjecture module using P5.js

The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 conjecture or the Ulam conjecture, is a mathematical hypothesis that states that for any positive integer n, if n is even, divide it by 2, and if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. The conjecture suggests that this sequence will eventually reach the value 1, regardless of the starting value of n.

For example, if we start with n = 6, we get the following sequence:

6 → 3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

The conjecture has been tested for all positive integers up to 2^68, and no counterexamples have been found, leading mathematicians to believe that it is true. However, the conjecture has not been proven mathematically and remains an unsolved problem in number theory.

## How to install this example Golang project on Kubernetes

The easiest way to see how this works is to watch the series, but here's the short version.

1. clone this project
2. Set up a p5.js Web Editor
3. enjoy it.

## How to tweak this project for your own uses

Since this is an example project, I'd encourage you to clone and rename this project to use for your own puposes. It's a good starter boilerplate
